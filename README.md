# Optical Disc Research Project (ODRP)

The current plan is to create a program that reads data from a disc within a USB optical drive.
I would like to support CDs at the very least, likely will try to implement DVDs as well.

### To Study:

#### 1. How does USB work?
#### 2. How does windows interact with USB?
#### 3. How is data stored on a CD?
#### 4. How can I get windows to receive data from the optical drive?
